    <h3><b>Title</b>: Average Surgery Duration & Recovery Times <br></h3> 
    <h3><b>Subtitle</b>: Comparing surgery and hospitalization durations across different procedures.<br></h3> 
    <h4>Layout: </h4>
     <p> We initially started out with a vertical column chart but later opted for a horizontal bar chart to improve the readability of our graph given the length of the operation names and labels. 
        Because our axes labels are long surgery names, it makes sense to place them on the y-axis and makes it easier on the reader to place them in the natural reading direction and to avoid any overlapping.
        Although we advanced substantially with a horizontal bar chart, we opted for a butterfly bar chart due to its visual emphasis on the separation and comparison of groups. 
        Moreover, given that we ultimately decided to measure average hospital stay in days and average surgery duration in minutes as it was intrinsically easier to comprehend than having hospital stay in minutes, the butterfly chart allowed our team to provide to dfferently measured and scalex x axis while still keeping both categories in close proximity for comparison.
        The majority of our choices were made from trial and error and through majority votes within the group. 
    </p>
    <h4>Graph Attributes: Axis, colors, labels, gridlines...</h4>
    <p> Our graph has vertical gridlines to help the viewer understand where a specific bar lies rather than having to look at the x axis and follow it to a specific bar each time. The gridlines are also faded in order to not overcrowd the background and distract the viewer.
        For a long time, the name of the sugeries was added as annotations on top of each bar in the middle but for surgeries with several operations, this proved to be even more crowded than our selected y axis ticks with the surgery names.
        As mentioned in the section above, the butterfly plot was chosen primarily thanks to its dual x axis which allowed us in turn to also label the x axis with both average surgery duration (minutes) and average hospital stay(minutes).
        At the risk of viewers perceiving this graph as political due to the colors chosen, we attempted to pull in symbolism wherein a soft coral is used not only due to its high contrast with blue but representing the blood or organs one might associate with sugery whilst the hospital duration is a blue often seen in nurse uniforms, hospital bedding...etc.
        Although shared with the interactivity section, our graph has dynamically adjusting x and y axes which allowed us to have such a wide range of values for each category and minimizing the compromise of comprehension for the viewer.

    <h4>Transitions and Interactivity:</h4>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Back Button: </b> </li>
        
        <li><b>OnClick Filtering</b></li>
        <li><b>Hover Tooltip and Highlight</b></li>
        <li><b> Google Link </b></li>
    </ul>
    This plot was always intended to have a way to filter the data such that viewers could filter by surgery type and further compare the values of hospital durations relative to surgery durations. We first began with a dropdown menu, then we replaced it with just clicking on the bars for transitions as it seemed more intuitive for the reader to do so. Initially, the chart showcases the main groupings of surgical procedures which upon interaction via click, cascade into the procedures belonging to that group. This allows an overview of surgery and hospital recovery times across the main types of procedures, while still offering granularity by offering a more detailed view of surgery and hospital recovery times by specific procedure types included in the data. Additionally, the viewer can then get more information on the listed procedure by clicking on it which will open a search for the procedure allowing the viewer access to information about the procedure which sounds trivial, but in reality can be difficult to do given the complexity of the surgical procedure names for someone who is not explicitly familiar with them.         </p>
    <p> <b>Annotations</b>:  To fully explore the recovery times between patients across different types of procedures, we have included an interactive tooltip where we display minimum and maximum durations for each group of procedures. This would help the viewer at a glance since averages can be heavily influenced by outliers, so by including these values we can provide a more informed picture.  </p></p> 
    <b>Motivation & Intended Audience: </b>:  This visualization is for patients and their families who might have to explore the logistics of having a loved one go through a major / minor surgical procedure. By analyzing the hospital recovery times and the length of the procedure itself, they can prepare themselves to be able to assist the patient in their hospital recovery. In the case that they have the choice between procedures, they can use this tool to better inform their decision using real data. This also helps to answer questions patients and their families might have, such as "how long will I be out of work to focus on my hospital recovery?" These questions can be answered using this visualizations given the state of (lack of) healthcare in the US, and avoiding even one day's stay in the hospital can mean a down payment on a house.
