    <h3><b>Title</b>: Average Surgery Duration & Hospital Recovery Times <br></h3> 
    <h3><b>Subtitle</b>: Comparing surgery and hospitalization durations across different procedures.<br></h3> 
    <h4>Layout: </h4>
     <p> We initially started out with a vertical column chart but later opted for a horizontal bar chart to improve the readability of our graph given the length of the operation names and labels. 
        Because our axes labels are long surgery names, it makes sense to place them on the y-axis and makes it easier on the reader to place them in the natural reading direction and to avoid any overlapping.
        Although we advanced substantially with a horizontal bar chart, we opted for a butterfly bar chart due to its visual emphasis on the separation and comparison of groups. 
         
        Moreover, given that we ultimately decided to measure average hospital stay in days and average surgery duration in hours as it was intrinsically easier to comprehend than having hospital stay in minutes, the butterfly chart allowed our team to provide a dfferently measured and scaled x axis while still keeping both categories in close proximity for comparison.
        The majority of our choices were made from trial and error and through majority votes within the group. 
    </p>
    <h4>Graph Attributes: Axis, colors, labels, gridlines...</h4>
    <p> Our graph has vertical gridlines to help the viewer understand where a specific bar lies rather than having to look at the x axis and follow it to a specific bar each time. The gridlines are also faded in order to not overcrowd the background and distract the viewer.
        For a long time, the name of the sugeries was added as annotations on top of each bar in the middle but for surgeries with several operations, this proved to be even more crowded than our selected y axis ticks with the surgery names.
        As mentioned in the section above, the butterfly plot was chosen primarily thanks to its dual x axis which allowed us in turn to also label the x axis with both average surgery duration (minutes) and average hospital stay(minutes).
        At the risk of viewers perceiving this graph as political due to the colors chosen, we attempted to pull in symbolism wherein a soft coral is used not only due to its high contrast with blue but representing the blood or organs one might associate with sugery whilst the hospital duration is a blue often seen in nurse uniforms, hospital bedding...etc.
        Although shared with the interactivity section, our graph has dynamically adjusting x and y axes which allowed us to have such a wide range of values for each category and minimizing the compromise of comprehension for the viewer.
    </p>
    <h4>Transitions and Interactivity:</h4>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Back Button: </b> At first, we were going to add a rectangle in the bakground such that a click would restore the graph. However, we found this was less intuitive than having a clear button to go back. Essentially our choice for this interative reset button was for the visualization exploration to be easy for anyone. </li>
        <li><b>OnClick Filtering: </b> This interative attribute was first collaborative to a dropdown button but we opted against it as we wanted viewers to experiment with moving their cursors over the graph as it would reveal more information than when filtering with the dropdown button.</li>
        <li><b>Hover Tooltip and Highlight: </b>  As you can see, if you hover over the main surgery categories (Breast, Colorectal...etc) and the specific duration you are interested in -for example Hospital Stay- the corresponding bar will becomed highlighted and a textbox with the surgery name, the average, maximum, and minimum duration appear.</li>
        <li><b> Google Link:</b> Past the first OnClick filter when one clicks on a main category surgery, if the viewer clicks on a bar of the operation types within the categories, this will open a new tab with a google search of the operation name. Ideally, we would have included a warning or annotation as it might be graphic but alas we thought it wasa fun way to provide more information on our data. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> The transitions in this graph are limited to the filtering both when clicking on a bar or reseting the graph by pressing the back button. This is a simple transition where the bars appear from their exact height from left to right. While we toyed with other transitions, this was one was of the most effective yet not distracting ones. Because of the dense nature of the surgery names, we did not want a transition that forced the viewer to follow the bars around the screen or caused confusion so we opted for this simple one.</p>
    <h4>Motivation & Intended Audience: </h4>
    
    This visualization is for healthcare management staff such as directors of surgical services in healthcare facilities who might be interested in the analysis to develop plans for better patient outcomes targeting post-operation recovery times. This can help healthcare leaders make evidence-based decisions in allocation of resources based on types of surgical procedures provided in the facility, such as budgeting, staffing, and even janitorial services. Managerial decisions supported by this kind of data can lead to reduction in waste and improvement in access to care.

    Additionally, this visualization could help patients and their families who might have to explore the logistics of having a loved one go through a major / minor surgical procedure. By analyzing the hospital recovery times and the length of the procedure itself, they can prepare themselves to be able to assist the patient in their hospital recovery. Though rare, in the chance that they have the choice between procedures, they can use this tool to better inform their decision using real data. This also helps to answer questions patients and their families might have, such as "how long will I be out of work to focus on my hospital recovery?" These questions can be answered using this visualizations given the state of (or rather lack thereof) healthcare in the US, where avoiding even one day's stay in the hospital can mean a down payment on a house.  </p>
