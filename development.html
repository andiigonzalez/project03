                <h2>Stage 1</h2>
                <h3>Brainstorm & Research</h3>
                <p>This stage consisted of discussing what dataset and question our project would focus on. Then, we each investigated on our own what potential visualizations were appropriate and feasible for our data. This took approximately 4.5 hours (1.5 hours each individually) with most of the time being spent on researching different D3 visualizations and how to implement them. Andrea also created the skeleton layout and repository where our website would be. The initial setup took her 20 minutes.  </p>

                <h3> Comparison & Analysis </h3>
                <p>At this point, each team member created 2-3 visualizations to create a general idea of our possibilities. We coded most of them using D3, which took around 10 hours due to challenges in parsing JSON data and coding interactive features. This step took each team member an average of 3 hours. Once we had a variety of potential visualizations our team deconstructed the pros and cons of each visuzalization. At this point we agreed on a barplot (althogh specifics remained more flexible). By the end of this stage, we submitted our project checkpoint.  </p>

                <h3></h3>
                <p> This stage includes the creation and molding of our finalized bargraph and a personalized take on the website. Because we wanted to experiment further on the website, we added a modified version of a javascript timeline for this process flow chart. The entire process of creating and perfecting this specific page took around 6 hours. </p>
